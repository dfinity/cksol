# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ckSOL! Bug reports, suggestions, and pull requests are all welcome.

## Reporting issues

- **Security vulnerabilities:** do **not** open a public issue. Follow the instructions in [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) instead.
- **Bugs and feature requests:** open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/dfinity/cksol/issues) with as much detail as possible (version or commit, steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior).
- **General questions:** ask on the [DFINITY developer forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/).

## Submitting a pull request

1. **Sign the CLA.** All external contributors must agree to the [DFINITY Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/dfinity/cla/blob/main/CLA.md). A bot will guide you through this on your first pull request.
2. **Discuss larger changes first.** For anything beyond a small fix, please open an issue first so we can agree on the approach before you invest time in it.
3. **Fork and branch.** Fork the repository and create a branch for your change. Keep each pull request focused on a single fix or feature.
4. **Build and test locally.** See [Building and Testing](https://dfinity.github.io/cksol/development/building-and-testing.html). At a minimum, run:

   ```bash
   just lint
   just unit-tests
   ```

5. **Use a conventional PR title.** CI enforces titles of the form `type(scope): description`, where `type` is one of `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `build`, `ci`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, or `test`, e.g. `fix(minter): handle expired blockhash`.
6. **Open the pull request** against `main` and describe what it changes and why.

All pull requests are reviewed by the code owners in [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) and must pass CI before they can be merged. CI workflows for pull requests from forks only run after a maintainer approves them.
